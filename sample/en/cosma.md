Welcome to Cosma, a visualization and sharing tool for knowledge workers [@perret2021].

Cosma application is divided into two parts: a [[20210901133503]] cosmographer and a [[20210901140150]] cosmoscope. The cosmographer reads a directory of text files written in Markdown, and renders them as HTML in the form of a file called the cosmoscope, which is displayed in the main window of Cosma but can also be used as a standalone file.

You are currently browsing a cosmoscope which serves as a quick-start documentation as well as a demonstration of how Cosma works. [A more comprehensive user documentation is available online](https://graphlab-fr.github.io/cosma/fr.html).

Click on Preferences to change the [[20210901145632]] configuration of Cosma.
