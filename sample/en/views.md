You can save the current state of the interface (selected record, active filters, focus modeâ€¦) for quick access. This works like a bookmark: click on the Save View button and enter a name; this adds an button with that name to the Views section in the left side menu of the cosmoscope.

Clicking the button for a view applies all settings that were active at the time the view was saved. Clicking the button again restores the normal view.

Saved views can be accessed in any cosmoscope, including when opened outside of Cosma, but they can only be created and deleted from within Cosma.
