You can create links between records by inserting identifiers between double brackets. Example:

```
A link to [[20201209111625]] a record.
```

In Preferences, you can define custom link types, with different colors and strokes.

To assign a type to a link, prefix the identifier with the name of a link type followed by a colon. Example:

```
Concept B derives from [[generic:20201209111625]] concept A.

Person D wrote against [[opponent:20201209111625]] person C.
```

**Tip:** Cosma includes an option to customize the appearance of links in the text of records. Use the Link Symbol option to visually lighten the text of your records by replacing the identifiers with a personal convention (for example a small manicule: â˜ž).
