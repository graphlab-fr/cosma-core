The Focus mode button (shortcut: `F` key) located at the bottom left of the graph allows you to restrict the display to the selected node. In Focus mode, only immediate connections to the selected record are displayed. Focus mode only works if you have selected a record.

Once Focus mode is activated, you automatically zoom in on the selected node.

The slider below the Focus mode button allows you to extend the range of focus, up to the maximum value specified in Preferences.

**Tip:** The focus level slider can be controlled with the keyboard arrows. You can use a combination of shortcuts: `F` to activate the focus, then the arrows to increase the focus level.
