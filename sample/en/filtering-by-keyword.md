The left side panel contains a list of all keywords used in the records. Selecting a keyword highlights the label of the corresponding nodes in the graph. It also restricts the index to the corresponding records. You can select multiple keywords simultaneously. To deselect a keyword, click the corresponding button again.

For a keyword to appear, it must have been declared in at least one record via the `tags` field of its YAML header.
