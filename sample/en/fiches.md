Records can be opened by clicking on a node, an index entry, a search engine suggestion, or a link in the body of another record. Opening a record displays its contents in the right side panel. In a browser, it also updates the URL of the page with the record ID: this allows you to navigate between the records you have visited via the browser's Back / Forward features, but also to find them in the history or to get a direct link to the record. Cosma includes limited navigation functionality similar to browsers via the Back / Next buttons (as well as the corresponding shortcuts that use the keyboard arrows).

Clicking on the Close button closes the pane and deselects the corresponding node in the graph.

The links in the cards are clickable. In a browser, you can open these links in a new tab by right-clicking. The title of the link (displayed in a tooltip after 1-2 seconds of hovering) is the title of the corresponding record.

**Tip:** click on Preferences › Link symbol to enter an arbitrary Unicode string that will replace the bracketed identifiers in the HTML rendering of the forms. This allows you to visually lighten the text of your forms by replacing long numeric identifiers with a personal convention (e.g. a small manicule: ☞)

At the bottom of the record is a list of all other records it links to (outbound links), as well as the records that point to it (inbound links or backlinks). The links and backlinks are contextualized: when hovering over them, a tooltip is displayed, showing the paragraph in which this link is found in the corresponding record.
