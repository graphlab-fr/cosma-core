The left side panel contains a list of record types. Clicking on a type allows you to hide/show again the corresponding records in the graph, the index and the search engine suggestions. Clicking on a type while holding down the `Alt` key hides/shows again records of all the other types.

For a type to appear in the cosmoscope, it must be defined in Preferences and be assigned to at least one record.
