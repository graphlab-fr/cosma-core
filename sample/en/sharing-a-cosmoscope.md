Click Share to generate a [[20210901140150]] cosmoscope meant to be shared. You can choose to turn on citation processing or not. The application will prompt you for an export location and a file name.

The About pane of exported cosmoscopes automatically integrates the metadata (title, author, description, keywords) you have defined in Preferences. The title also replaces the toolbar at the top of the left side menu: the toolbar has use only within the Cosma application, and so is hidden in exported cosmoscopes.
